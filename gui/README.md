# AIDEme Frontend

This folder implements the frontend of our AIDEme data exploration system demo.
The frontend is built with react.js.

Each part of the interface is represented by a component

## Instructions

To start AIDEme's frontend, simply open a terminal at the `gui` folder and run the following commands: 

```shell
npm install  # install dependencies 
npm start  # start development server
```

Note that you only need to install dependencies once.

## Folder structure
The frontend code is structured as follows: 

- **actions**: folder contains functions to call the backend (currently java)

- **components**: folder contains react components

- **constants**: folder contains algorithm configuration

- **model**: folder contains some classes containing logic (manipulating dataset)

- **lib**: folder contains some utility functions

- **resources**: image and other resources
